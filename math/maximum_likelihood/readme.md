### What is likelihood function ?
I like [the answer on stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2641/what-is-the-difference-between-likelihood-and-probability)<br>
Likelihood function is a function of the parameters of a statistical model, it describes the plausibility of a parameter value of the statistical model assumed to describe the observed data, given specific observed data. it's always defined as a function of $\theta$.
For discrete probability distribution, 

$$
\mathcal { L } ( \theta | x ) = p _ { \theta } ( x ) = P _ { \theta } ( X = x )
$$
the likelihood function of $\theta$ equals to the probability of $ X = x$ given the value of $\theta$`. <br>
For continuous probability distribution,

$$
\mathcal { L } ( \theta | x ) = f _ { \theta } ( x )
$$
the likelihood function of $\theta$ equals to the density function of $X = x$ given the value of $\theta$. <br>
